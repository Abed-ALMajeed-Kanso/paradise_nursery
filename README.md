Paradise Nursery is a simple, single-page (SAP) React application designed for selling plants online. The app allows users 
to browse a variety of plants, view details, and add them to a shopping cart. It uses Redux for state management to handle 
the cart functionality, ensuring that users can add, remove, and update items in their cart seamlessly. The project is  
frontend-only project, meaning there is no backend integration. The images are integrated from Pixabay. The project was 
a part of a course I completed on Coursera.
